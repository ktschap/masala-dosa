<li class=padded><div id=upload class=helpcontent>How do I upload class flyer files?</div>
<p>
	 <span class=bold>Note that uploaded files must be less than 1 MB in size.</span> 
	 From the top menu of the admin pages, select <a href="/admin/FileUp.do">Class Flyers</a>.
	This page allows you to view flyers currently available in the system, and delete any of those that are no longer needed. To upload a new flyer,
	enter a name for the flyer, and click the browse button to locate the file on your local machine. It is <span class=bold>strongly</span> 
	recommended to choose a flyer name that will allow you to identify its semester/year, and class. This will allow you to clearly 
	relate the named flyer to the class, and to determine whether it is currently needed or is from a previous semester and can be permanently deleted.
</p> 
<p>
	Once the flyer name is filled in, click "Import Flyer" to upload.
